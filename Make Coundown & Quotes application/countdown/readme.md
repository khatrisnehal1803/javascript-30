üìù Project Description: Countdown Timer App
Title: Countdown Timer with Stylish UI and Time‚Äôs Up Notification

Overview: This is a simple yet visually appealing countdown timer web application. Users can input a number of seconds, click the Start button, and watch the timer count down to zero. When time runs out, a "Time's up!" message appears with a subtle animation.

Features:

Input field to enter countdown duration in seconds.

Live countdown display that updates every second.

Displays a "Time's up!" message when the countdown reaches zero.

Smooth visual effects on timer completion.

Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structure.

CSS3 for layout and styling:

Modern look with flexbox for centering.

Responsive design with media queries.

Stylish transitions and scaling effects.

JavaScript / jQuery for logic and interactivity:

Parses user input.

Handles validation.

Manages countdown logic and DOM updates.

Extra Notes:

There's both pure JavaScript and jQuery logic for the countdown in index.html and countdown.js. To avoid duplication and confusion, it's recommended to keep only one implementation (preferably the jQuery one from countdown.js, or remove jQuery entirely and use pure JS for simplicity).
