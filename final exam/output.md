ðŸ“– Project: Recipe Book App
This is a simple web application where users can add, view, and filter recipes.
The main components are:

HTML (index.html):
Structures the page into different sections:

A search bar (though it's not fully functional yet).

A form where users can enter a recipe title, ingredients, and instructions.

A filter dropdown to view either all recipes, short recipes, or long recipes.

A section to display the list of added recipes.

CSS (style.css):
Provides basic styling to the page:

A clean, minimal layout with centered headers.

Proper spacing and padding around inputs and buttons.

A light background for a soft visual.

JavaScript (exam.js):
Adds the interactive functionality:

Captures the submitted recipe data.

Stores recipes in an array.

Displays the list of recipes dynamically on the page.

Includes a filter feature to show short or long recipes (though the filter logic needs to be completed).

Some parts like form resetting and search functionality are unfinished or incorrect.

ðŸš© Main Issues (currently):
Several typos in IDs and method names (Value instead of value, reciperFrom instead of recipeFrom, etc.).

Filtering isn't completed.

Recipe list doesn't show yet because the target div is missing an ID.

Search bar is placed but not functional yet.

Minor UI details (like margins) can be improved.
