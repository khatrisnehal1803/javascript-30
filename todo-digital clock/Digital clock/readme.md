📜 Description of the Digital Clock Code
This project is a digital clock with animated neon borders using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The design features a stylish glowing effect with smooth animations, making it visually appealing.

🛠 Code Breakdown:
1️⃣ HTML Structure (index.html)
The HTML file provides the basic structure for the digital clock:

A container (.clock-border) to hold the clock display.

A header (<h2>Digital Clock</h2>) for the title.

A clock display area (#digital-clock) to show the current time.

Borders (.left-border, .right-border) for animated effects.

External files:

style.css (for styling)

colok.js (for the clock functionality)

jQuery (for easy DOM manipulation).

2️⃣ CSS Styling (style.css)
The CSS file is responsible for styling the clock and adding animations.

🔹 Key Features:
✔ Background Gradient:

The page background has a dark gradient (linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a2e, #16213e, #0f3460)) for a futuristic look.

✔ Clock Container (.clock-box):

Semi-transparent glass effect using backdrop-filter: blur(10px).

Glowing border and shadow for a cyberpunk feel.

✔ Clock Text (#digital-clock):

Large, blue neon-colored text with a glowing effect using text-shadow.

Glowing animation (@keyframes glow) makes the text pulse.

✔ Animated Borders (.clock-border & .left-border, .right-border):

Moving neon borders around the clock using CSS animations.

Uses @keyframes to animate the borders from one side to another.

3️⃣ JavaScript Logic (colok.js)
The JavaScript (jQuery) updates the time every second.

🔹 How it Works:
updateClock() function:

Gets the current time using new Date().

Extracts hours, minutes, and seconds.

Ensures each value is always two digits (.padStart(2, '0')).

Updates #digital-clock with the formatted time.

setInterval(updateClock, 1000);

Runs updateClock() every second to refresh the time.

Calls updateClock() once before starting the interval (to prevent delay).

🎯 Summary:
✅ Displays a real-time digital clock.
✅ Uses CSS animations to create a glowing neon effect.
✅ Automatically updates every second using JavaScript.
✅ Smooth and visually appealing design with a cyberpunk style.
