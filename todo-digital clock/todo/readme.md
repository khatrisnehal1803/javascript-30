📌 To-Do List Web Application
This project is a simple and interactive To-Do List built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). It allows users to add, mark, and manage tasks efficiently with a clean, responsive design.

✨ Features
✅ Task Input & Addition:

Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.

Pressing Enter also adds the task for a smoother experience.

✅ Task Display:

Tasks appear in an ordered list (<ol>), showing the task name along with a timestamp of when it was added.

Tasks have alternating background colors for better readability.

✅ Task Completion:

Clicking the radio button next to a task marks it as completed with a strikethrough effect.

✅ Styling & Responsiveness:

The UI follows a minimalistic design, using a white card layout with a subtle shadow effect.

Buttons and input fields are well-styled to enhance user experience.

🛠️ Technology Used
🖥 HTML → Provides the structure of the to-do list.
🎨 CSS → Styles the list with colors, spacing, and alignment.
⚡ JavaScript & jQuery → Handles user interactions, such as adding tasks and marking them as completed.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project is a great beginner-friendly exercise for learning:

DOM manipulation (dynamically adding/removing elements).

Event handling (button clicks, keypress events).

Basic UI/UX design principles (readability, responsiveness).

A great starting point for web development and front-end JavaScript! 🚀
