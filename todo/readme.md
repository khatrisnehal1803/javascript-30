Description of the To-Do List Project
This project is a simple To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The application allows users to add, mark, and manage tasks efficiently.
Features:
âœ… Task Input & Addition:
Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
Pressing Enter also adds the task.
âœ… Task Display:
Each task appears in an ordered list (<ol>), showing the task name along with a timestamp of when it was added.
The tasks are displayed in alternating background colors for better readability.
âœ… Task Completion:
Clicking on the radio button next to a task marks it as completed by adding a strikethrough effect.
âœ… Styling & Responsiveness:
The design includes a clean and minimalistic UI, using a white card layout with a shadow effect.
The button and input field are well-styled to enhance user experience.
Technology Used:
HTML â†’ Structure of the web page.
CSS â†’ Styling the to-do list with colors, spacing, and alignment.
JavaScript & jQuery â†’ Handles user interactions (adding tasks, marking them as completed).
This project is a great starting point for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI design in web development. ðŸš€
